- Properties hold values
- function are method that has some logic
- When an object has more than one method, object has behaviour to do different things


- Duplicating objects
- When an object is duplicated, if it has 0 method, it is not a big problem, however if it behavior, it is a big problem, and makes it redundant.
- Direct copy of object ctrl-c ctrl-v is called creating ibject using object literal syntax
- In such case we can use a factory function/constructors to create a new object, and return it.
